    "# Comparing Bubble Growth Due to Pressure Drop and Due to Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Dow UPI biweekly meeting on 1/13/20, a discussion arose posing the question of whether the bubble growth due to diffusion of CO2 is important relative to that due to the pressure drop after nucleation. Clearly the pressure drop is most important by the time the pressure drops to atmosphere due to the tremendous factor by which the pressure decreases, but partway through the channel this might not be the case. Below we compare"

    "We first consider the amount of volume change due to diffusion. If we assume a diffusivity of CO2 in polyol of $D$ and a time in the channel of $\\tau$, the diffusion length scale is $l = \\sqrt{D*\\tau}$. Thus, we can approximate the amount of CO2 that diffuses into the bubble as the amount dissolved in the volume of the layer $l$ away from the surface of the bubble. Assuming a bubble radius $R$, which we assume to be constant at the final value to get an upper bound on the result, this volume is $V_{diffn} \\approx 4\\pi R^2 l$, assuming $l \\ll R$. The mass density of CO2 in this volume is then $\\rho_{CO2} = w_{CO2} \\rho_{liq}$, where $w_{CO2}$ is mass fraction of CO2 in the parent phase and $\\rho_{liq}$ is the mass density of the liquid phase. Within an order of magnitude, we estimate the number of moles of CO2 that diffuse into the bubble to be $n_{diffn} = \\frac{\\rho_{CO2}V_{diffn}}{MW_{CO2}}$. The fractional increase in volume can be estimate as \n",
