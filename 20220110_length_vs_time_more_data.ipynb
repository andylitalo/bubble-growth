    "# Analyzing Length vs. Time of Elongated Bubbles: More Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I did exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the length vs. time of elongated bubbles from a few videos in `20220110_length_vs_time_eda.ipynb`. I found that an exponential model describes the data pretty well, but observed that some growth profiles deviated from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I will check if the exponential model can describe a larger pool of data and explore how the trends in the deviations of the data from the model. Might an exponential model describe all the data but require different parameters for different measurements? Or might it turn out that an exponential model is not the appropriate description?"
